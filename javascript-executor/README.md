# How is executor work ? (Javascript)
- Only limited amount of container will be created by executor (20 by default).
- Container will self destroyed when it's finished a task.
- Container's output will be written into file (logs.txt, result.txt).
- Container will check code before execute it, the syntax error as well as malicious code will throw and executor can read it through stderr.
- Executor compare code's result against assertion dedicated for each task.
- Executor get content from logs.txt, result.txt generated by container.
- The final result is formatted and write into broker. Note: the consumer of this data need to send it back to client using websocket hence a unique id is important here.
